Script (WaitingArea)

Script for the WaitingAreas seen in the lobby.

Build to teleport the player and start the game, with a player limit per area, limited by the player, with exit buttons and stuff.

--------------UPDATE------------------

(05/05/2025)

Update after first attempt to apply for Scripter on HiddendDevs.

The two reasons given to me to justify why my application failed were that:

1- I did not demonstrate that I had complied with the rules of sophistication and functionality for the script, so I redid a good part of the script to make it more organized and easier to read. 

Furthermore, I was suggested to use more varied APIs in the script, and that's what I tried to do, applying TweenService, CollectionService, SoundService, adjustments with ParticleEmitter and Lighting. I tried to demonstrate that I know how to deal with these elements as well.

2- I was told that my notes were not complete and descriptive enough, not only to say what the script does but to try to explain how it works, and that's what I tried to do, adding severe notes throughout the script, in places that I considered to be "key places".

Completing the update, I say that I know that the script is huge, and I probably could have divided a good part of it into smaller scripts, since no application rule is explicitly against this, but to simplify, I decided to leave everything in a single script (even though this may not be good for optimization).

I hope that with the changes, the script is qualified enough.
